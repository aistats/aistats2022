We invite submissions to the 25th International Conference on Artificial
Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), and welcome paper submissions on
artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and related areas.

The AISTATS 2022 organization team is committed to diversity in all its forms,
and encourages submissions from authors of underrepresented groups and
geographies in ML/AI.

### Key dates

The dates are as follow:

The deadlines are firm. We realize the pandemic is making lives difficult, so
we ask the authors to factor in any uncertainties when preparing their papers.

### Summary

AISTATS is an interdisciplinary gathering of researchers at the intersection of
computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and
related areas. Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of AISTATS has
been to broaden research in these fields by promoting the exchange of ideas
among them. We encourage the submission of all papers which are in keeping with
this objective at AISTATS.

## Paper Submission (Proceedings Track)

The proceedings track is the standard AISTATS paper submission track. Papers
will be selected via a rigorous double-blind peer-review process. All accepted
papers will be presented at the Conference as contributed talks or as posters
and will be published in the Proceedings.

Solicited topics include, but are not limited to:

* Machine learning methods and algorithms (classification, regression,
  unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, clustering, logic programming,
...)
* Probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, approximate inference, density
  estimation, tractable probabilistic models, probabilistic programming, ...)
* Theory of machine learning and statistics (optimization, computational
  learning theory, decision theory and bandits, game theory, frequentist
statistics,  information theory, ...)
* Deep learning (theory, architectures, reinforcement learning, generative
  models, optimization for neural networks, ...)
* Ethical and trustworthy machine learning (causality, fairness,
  interpretability, privacy, robustness, safety, ...)
* Applications of machine learning and statistics (including natural language,
  signal processing, computer vision, social sciences, sustainability and
climate, healthcare, economics, ...)

## Physical Attendance

The AISTATS 2022 organizing committee is committed to the safety and health of
our community. We are currently reviewing the best option for AISTATS 2022
(either physical or virtual conference). In any case, **physical attendance will
not be mandatory for authors of accepted papers.** As soon as we have made a
final decision, we will update the information to the webpage. Thank you for
your patience and understanding.

AISTATS will try to provide registration-free funding to eligible students
(first authors), specially to those from underrepresented groups or
demographics.


## Formatting and Supplementary Material

Submissions are limited to 8 pages excluding references using the LaTeX style
file we provide below (the page limit will be 9 for camera-ready submissions).
The number of pages containing citations alone is not limited. You can also
submit a single file of additional supplementary material which may be either a
pdf file (such as proof details) or a zip file for other formats/more files
(such as code or videos). Note that reviewers are under no obligation to
examine the supplementary material. If you have only one supplementary pdf
file, please upload it as is; otherwise gather everything to the single zip
file.

Submissions will be through CMT
(<https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2022/>) and will be open
approximately 4-6 weeks before the abstract submission deadline.

Formatting information (including LaTeX style files) is available at
[http://aistats.org/aistats2022/AISTATS2022CameraReadyPaperPack.zip]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/AISTATS2022PaperPack.zip). We do not support
submission in preparation systems other than LaTeX. Please do not modify the
layout given by the style file. If you have questions about the style file or
its usage, please contact the publications chair.

## Reviewer Nomination

For each submission, the authors will be requested to nominate at least one of
the authors as a reviewer for AISTATS 2022. Nominated reviewers are expected to
have sufficient expertise in the relevant field. Kindly understand that by a
recent increase of submissions, we need more reviewers than previous years.

## Anonymization Requirements

The AISTATS review process is double-blind. All submissions must be anonymized
and may not contain any information that can violate the double-blind reviewing
policy, such as the author names or their affiliations, acknowledgements, or
links that can infer any authorâ€™s identity or institution. Self-citations are
allowed as long as anonymity is preserved. It is up to the author's discretion
how best to preserve anonymity when including self-citations. Possibilities
include: leaving out a self-citation, including it but replacing the citation
text with "removed for anonymous submission," or leaving the citation as-is. We
recommend leaving in a moderate number of self-citations for published or
otherwise well-known work.

We strongly discourage advertising the preprint on social media or in the press
while under submission to AISTATS. Preprints must not be explicitly identified
as an AISTATS submission at any time during the review period (i.e., from the
abstract submission deadline until the communication of the accept/reject
decision).

## Dual Submissions

Submitted manuscripts should not have been previously published in a journal or
in the proceedings of a conference, and should not be under consideration for
publication at another conference at any point during the AISTATS review
process. Submissions as extended abstracts (4 pages or less), to workshops or
non-archival venues (without a proceedings), or to arXiv, will not be
considered a concurrent submission. It is acceptable to have a substantially extended version of the submitted paper under consideration simultaneously for journal publication, so long as the journal version's planned publication date is in May 2022 or later and the journal submission does not interfere with AISTATS right to publish the paper. Authors are also allowed to give talks
to restricted audiences on the work(s) submitted to AISTATS during the review.

Reviewers will be instructed that tech reports (including reports on sites such
as arXiv) and papers in workshops without archival proceedings do not count as
prior publication.

All accepted papers will be presented at the Conference either as contributed
talks or as posters, and will be published in the AISTATS Conference
Proceedings in the Journal of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference
Proceedings series. Papers for talks and posters will be treated equally in
publication.

## Confidentiality

The reviewers and area-chairs of your paper will have access to your paper and
supplementary material. In addition, the program chairs and workflow chairs
will have access to all the papers. Everyone having access to papers and
supplementary materials will be instructed to keep them confidential during the
review process and delete them after the final decisions.

Reviews will be visible to area chairs, program chairs, and workflow chairs
throughout the process. Reviewers will get access to other reviews for a paper
after they have submitted their own review.

Author names will be visible to area chairs and program chairs. Reviewers will
not know the author names at any stage of the process. Reviewer names are
visible to the area chair and to the other reviewers of each paper (as well as
to program chairs).
