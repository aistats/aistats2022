# The Schedule

The conference schedule is compiled once all the accepted papers are in place.

A good idea is to anchor your schedule around your [invited speakers](./invited-speakers.md). 
You can frame each conference session by selecting an invited speaker to kick it off.

Fine tuning the schedule to fit everything in can be a problem. There will be a balance between
the number of talks, the number of posters, and if you choose to have them the number of spotlights.

As machine learning conferences have become bigger, it has become difficult to fit everything in. 
One thing is clear that there's no *right* answer in how to do things. And different attendees prefer
different approaches.

With AISTATS it's worth bearing in mind that the original tradition was to leave a lot of time for attendees
to get together in breaks. The original conferences would leave lunch followed by a block of free time for
attendees to get together informally. This has been part of what has made the conference special. 

Of course pressure to bring in more talks has forced changes, but don't forget that the main advantage of a
conference is the time people have to see each other face to face and an overly full schedule can inhibit that.

The repo is designed for the schedule to appear online directly. This allows for late changes in the schedule. 
We suggest you use this schedule as your primary source. That will ease communication. Ideally, attendees will 
also be able to fix any errors using the [giki philosophy](./giki.md) behind the site.
