## Statement  
 
The AISTATS 2022 organizing committee is committed to the safety and health of
our community.  We are currently reviewing all options for AISTATS 2022 (e.g.,
physical meeting, virtual meeting).  

In any case, **no physical attendance would
be required for the authors of accepted papers**. As soon as we have made a
final decision, we will update this page with more information.  

We appreciate your patience and understanding.
