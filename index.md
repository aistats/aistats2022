Since its inception in 1985, AISTATS has been an interdisciplinary gathering of researchers at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and related areas.


\***Disclaimer**:  We are currently reviewing the best option for AISTATS 2022,
  either physical in Valencia, (Spain) or a virtual conference. As the AISTATS
2022 organizing committee is committed to the safety and health of our
community, the decision will be made when possible based on the global health
situation.
