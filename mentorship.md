# Submission Mentoring Program

The AISTATS 2022 organizing committee is pleased to announce a pilot program to
assist underrepresented and/or first-time AISTATS submitters. This program will
match submitters (mentees) with senior researchers (mentors) to provide
 targeted feedback on their AISTATS submission. Applications to receive/provide
mentorship will be accepted on a rolling basis until September 20th, 2021
following [this link](https://forms.gle/eQMxu293dM8ZfC6H7). 

To apply to be a mentee, please prepare a PDF of up to 3-pages with a
draft/excerpt/extended abstract of your submission, and 2-4 names of senior
researchers you would like to be matched with. While we cannot guarantee an
exact match, we will try our best. 

To apply to be a mentor, you should be an assistant professor+ (academia) or
senior research scientist+ (industry). You can also nominate someone else.
Mentors will be acknowledged on the AISTATS website. 

#### Timelines 
- Sep 20: last day to apply to be a mentee/mentor. Matches made on a rolling
  basis up to this date, no later than 1 week after application is received
- Sep 27: mid-program check-in
- Oct 8: AISTATS abstract submission deadline
- Oct 15: AISTATS paper submission deadline

#### Mentee/mentor expectations
- Mentees and mentors are expected to communicate via email and/or video/audio
  chat 
- We will check in around Sep 27 to see if the match is going well. Mentees or
  mentors can request a new match if needed at that time. 
- Time commitment is ~1 hour/week until the paper deadline, or ~5 hours total. 

Data sharing: For mentees, the PDF/extended abstract will be shared with senior
researchers to organize a match. For both mentees/mentors, your contact info
will be shared with your mentor/mentee once matched. Email
[aistats2022+mentorship@gmail.com](mailto:aistats2022+mentorship@gmail.com)
